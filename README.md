# DCS TOOLS
This is a series of scripts to make my Linux life easier.

# Manually modifying is needed
In order to use this well, I did not include scripts related to personal information.
- run `bash_aliases` to include this tool to bashrc
- create keys for key-free ssh login. This need to modify `~/.ssh/config` to include different (site,key) pair


# Verify installation
If successfully installed, you can test it by input `haha` as command, it should return the string like this:
```bash
DCS@localhost:~$ haha
We do nothing, but print one haha
```
